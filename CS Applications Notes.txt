  basic operators
      + , - , * , / , **(raise to power)
  idle
      shell
  advanced operators
      // - integer division
        how many times something goes into something else
          5//2 returns 2
      % - modulus
        used to get remainder after division
          5%2 returns 1

    how integers and floats interact
      int / int == float
    built-in functions
      print()
      int()
        converts to integer by truncating
      round()
      type()
        tells you what type of

    datatypes
      anything that the computer uses and recognizes
        ints
        floats
        strings
          characters enclosed in double or single quotations
            double and single quotes so you can have a single quote in a string
          concatenation is the adding of strings together
        Booleans
          either True or False
            not true and false need to be uppercase
          None if nothing - like null in java
    comparison operators
      always gives either true or false
        >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
        strings have to match exactly
        numbers just have to match numerically
        letters are assigned to numbers lowercase are bigger than smaller
    recursion
      calling a function from inside the same function
        example in JS
          function recursion(){
            recursion();
          }

  comparison operators cont.
    in
      "c" in "cat"
        True
      "at" in "cat"
        True
      "ct" in "cat"
        False
    logical operators
      and, or, not, xor, nand
        xor
          t + t = f
          f + f = f
          f + t = t
          t + f = t

  boolean expressions
    if statement
      if Boolean expression:
        #block of code here
        do the stuff
