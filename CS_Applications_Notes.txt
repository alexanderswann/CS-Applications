  basic operators
      + , - , * , / , **(raise to power)
  idle is a python shell and it is where the code runs
  advanced operators
      // - integer division/floor division
        how many times something goes into something else
          5//2 returns 2
      % - modulus
        used to get remainder after division
          5%2 returns 1
  more advanced operators
    use ~ import math
      ceiling
        math.ceil()
      square root
        math.sqrt()

    how integers and floats interact
      int / int == float
    built-in functions
      print()
      int()
        converts to integer by truncating
      round()
      type()
        tells you the type of your input
  In Class Assignment 1/17 - Math Race
    create math challenges for the
    other half of the class to
    complete as fast as possible while
    we solve theirs

    datatypes
      anything that the computer uses and recognizes
        ints
        floats
        strings
          characters enclosed in double or single quotations
              double and single quotes so you can have a single quote in a string
          concatenation is the adding of strings together
        Booleans
          either True or False
            not true and false need to be uppercase
          None if nothing - like null in java
    comparison operators
      always gives either true or false
        >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
        strings have to match exactly
        numbers just have to match numerically
        letters are assigned to numbers lowercase are bigger than smaller
    recursion
      calling a function from inside the same function
        example in JS
          function recursion(){
            recursion();
          }

    comparison operators cont.
      in
        "c" in "cat"
          True
        "at" in "cat"
          True
        "ct" in "cat"
          False
      logical operators
        and, or, not, xor, nand
          xor
            t + t = f
            f + f = f
            f + t = t
            t + f = t

    boolean expressions
      if statement
        if Boolean expression:
          #block of code here
          do the stuff

    In Class Assignment 1/25 - Basic Conditionals

      In a comment at the top of your code, write your name and the date.
      For files that you submit in this class, I require you to name your files in the following format:
      FirstLast_AssignmentName
      The assignment name will be at the top of the assignment description. Use camel case for multiple words, so this assignment should be BasicConditionals.
      When you are finished, submit your python file in Google Classroom. Upload the file under the assignment page for this assignment.


      Create two variables at the top of your script, number and word, and assign them to an arbitrary integer and string. You should update them to test if your conditionals described below give the correct output.

      Write if statements for each of the following problems below, and if the statement’s condition evaluates to True have your program print out the output given.

      1) if word contains the substring ‘sh’: output → ‘Has sh’

      2) if number is not a multiple of seven: output → ‘Not divisible by 7’

      3) if number is in the range 90-100, inclusive: output → ‘You got an A!’

      4) if word has either ‘f’ or ‘g’ but not both: output → ‘Contains either an f or a g’

      5) if word has no vowels (just aeiou, not y): output → ‘Possibly not a real word’

      The ord() function accepts a string of a single character as input and returns what integer it corresponds to in the ASCII Table. For example ord(‘!’) returns 33.

      6) Create a variable called character and assign it to a string of a single character. Using the ord() function and an if statement, determine if that character is a capital letter.

      7) Without using any logical operators (and, or, not), have your program print out ‘Bazinga!’ if number is both a multiple of three and an even number.

      8) Now, instead of you as the programmer choosing to assign values to number and word, get input from the user to assign values to those variables.

      In Python, you can use the input(‘...’) function to get input from the user of your program.
      The string that the function has as an argument will be the prompt that the user sees.
      Make sure you give the user enough information so that they know what they should be entering.
      The input function always returns a string, even if a number is entered. What function that we talked about before should you use to convert the string to an integer?

      In a comment at the end of your file, explain what user input is and why this is important in programming.

      flags
        using a True or False to see if a condition is met
          ex. checks if a number is divisible by 3 and is even
          bazinga = True

          if not number % 3 == 0:
            bazinga = False
          if not number % 2 == 0:
            bazinga = False

          if bazinga:
            print('Bazinga!')

    In Class Assignment 1/30 - More Conditionals
      -Complete the following five problems on the attached pdf: 34, 35, 38, 39, 45
      -Each problem requires you to get input from the user
      -You must complete each problem using only one 'if family', meaning you can only use a single 'if' statement, as many 'elif' statements as you want, and zero or one else statements

      project file path - CS-Applications\alexanderSwann_MoreConditionals.py

  -Remember to save the file according to the naming scheme required for this class: FirstLast_AssignmentName (MoreConditionals is this assignment title)
  -Also remember to put your name and date in a comment at the top of your code

  Iteration
    repeating blocks of code
      for loop
        ex. for element in sequence
              repeat this block
            aList = [3,-2,1,2]
            for item in aList
              print(item*2)
            item is a variables that gets assigned to the elements in aList one at a time, for each loop through the block
    built-in functions such as the print function also have builtin parameters
      print(x, end="")
        what ever is specified in end is what will happen after something prints
    print the number of 'a's in a string
      word = "Aardvark"
      a = 0
      for letter in word:
          if str.lower(letter) == "a":
              a+=1
      print(a)
        there is no ++ in python
    get a phrase of input from the user
      range function
        explain the range function
        In your own words, describe to me what the output of the range() function is with 1, 2, and 3 arguments.
          1 argument: with one argument the range function count from 0 to one minus the value of the first argument while counting by one
          2 arguments: with two arguments the range function count from the first argument to the second argument minus one while counting by one
          3 arguments: with two arguments the range function count from the first argument to the second argument minus one while counting by the value of the third argument

    function that returns a list of only even numbers form another list
    def getEvens(aList):
        evens = []
        for i in range(len(aList)):
            if aList[i] % 2 == 0:
                evens.append(aList[i])
        return print(evens)
    getEvens([3,4,4,2,5,6,45,7,65,7,66])

    def getEvens(aList):
        evens = []
        for num in aList:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                evens.append(num)
        return print(evens)
    getEvens([3,4,4,2,5,6,45,7,65,7,66])

    the differnece between one and two is that in the first one i is assigned to a numbers
